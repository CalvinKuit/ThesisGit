  "Easier said than done.",
  "For Youtube, [Remove Youtube Suggestions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/remove-youtube-suggestion/cdhdichomdnlaadbndgmagohccgpejae?hl=en) is an extension I wrote and use that gives the option to block the feed as well as comments. It also hides other suggested videos on the side bar and at the end of videos.",
  
  'First, make your phone a ["dumb smartphone"](https://imgur.com/KjDvdqG)\n\nUnplug your laptop or monitor, walk with it, all the way down to the other side of the house, and leave it there. Only get it during specified hours. It’s a physical ritual.\n\nTrain your habitual musculature to do real-world activities. Improvements open doors to secondary and tertiary improvements in mental health.\n\n**Aggregators:**\n\nThe internet should be used is passively with aggregators, not actively with feeds. Feeds offer a false sense of informedness. If you scroll thru junk all day, you\'re as good as Amish; you\'re not utilizing the internet. Content should be delivered in daily batches. Even Twitter and Pinterest can be aggregators if checked once-a-day with a 10-minute time-limit. **Aggregators and time-limits give you the confidence that you’ve seen what you were meant to discover for the day.** Use YouTube Subscriptions as a news/culture aggregator. Use Chrome Extensions: "Block the YouTube Feed" &amp; "Hide YouTube Comments," &amp; use ad block and dark theme. When done, put your device in another room.\n\n**A Tactile Sense of Organization:**\n\nI think everyone should have two computer setups: a TV lounge and a work desk.\n\n**🖵** [The TV Lounge](https://imgur.com/1isaJLn) is only for streaming media. It uses a Logitech K600 keyboard. Logitech can set shortcut keys to URLs, making you one button from your media &amp; music library. Print labels on sticker paper. This bypasses all predatory “feeds” and distractions with a tactile, always-visible button. It beats smartTV interfaces which are slow and full of ads and feeds. &amp; above all, media is physically separated from your upright and focused activities.\n\n**🖵** [The Work Desk](https://imgur.com/OG5JShi) is only for **time-limited,** upright, focused work. Includes Reddit, Pinterest, researching, and shopping. Anything that can be treated with the energy of a research project. Use LeechBlock (includes time limits). I set all my blocked pages to redirect to [https://isitchristmas.com/](https://isitchristmas.com/) because it looks good with a dark mode extension. Always use the full time limit in one sitting. Do not sprinkle a 10-minute time limit over hours of mindless surfing. Your goal with LeechBlock is to remove all feeds. I like a closet-desk setup because you can physically close it away.\n\nPaste in LeechBlock options box: (The third line lets you read Reddit comment pages found in google search results)\n\nreddit.com\n\n\\+reddit.com/message/\n\n\\+reddit.com/r/\\*/comments\n\n\\+reddit.com/[r/nosurf](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/)', 
  'No matter your issue, physically stowing the laptop or mouse far away &amp; out of sight, for half the day, will teach your body new habits in the physical world.\n\n&amp; use your phone exclusively for phone, text, music, maps. Delete the apps, put the rest in a folder, and use grayscale)\n\n**Introduce new physical habits:** changing clothes, working out, nature walks, housekeeping, spa time, tea &amp; music time, guitar, painting and framing, rearranging decor, trying different lamps and return them as you learn what looks good, try new blankets, pillow cases. Be present and busy in the physical world; your mind will connect the dots.'

1. Posts tend to be longer than comments
2. Note that there are some very short posts/comments. Plan that these be removed when cleaning for sentiment analysis and topic modelling later.
